# A'therys Scripting

The one-stop shop for all your AScript documentation needs. Yes, that's right, the short version of "AtherysScript" is "AScript".

## Basic Introduction

The main goal of AScript is to simplify the introduction of simple functionality to a server. Instead of writing tiny plugins for the purposes of modifying your server in some small way, consider using a script instead. It doesn't need compilation, it doesn't have any dependencies, you can write it in the simplest of text editors. 

Modifying it is simple too, and you can easily change how your script works fundamentally with a simple reload of the AScript plugin.

## Recommended Editor

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with our [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AtherysHorizons.atheryscode).
