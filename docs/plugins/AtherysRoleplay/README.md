# AtherysRoleplay
AtherysRoleplay provides character cards and dice rolling, with more features to come.

## Character Cards
Character cards are attached to a player. The following fields are supported:
* Name
* Nickname
* Age
* Nation
* Description

The maximum age, name, and nickname are configurable. You can also configure the names, colors, and item for nations. The item will show up in the menu for choosing a nation.

The command to open the card menu is `/card`. Commands for setting individual fields are also supported: `/card name / nick / age / nation / desc /`. To view another player's character card, you can shift right click them. 

## Dice Rolling
You can roll dice in chat with the command `/roll`. It accepts arguments in the form `6`, `d20`, and `2d6`.
